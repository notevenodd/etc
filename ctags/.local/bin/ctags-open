# Usage: [CTAGS_OPENER=...] ctags-open TAG [CTAGS_FILE]
#    open the appropriate file at appropriate line number which correspond
#    to the given TAG. Using $CTAGS_OPENER (or by default $VISUAL or $EDITOR)
#    to open. (see the source of the script, for more info)

# Using Ctags with nano and other editors
# see: http://sassan.me.uk/blog/using-ctags-with-nano-and-other-editors/
#
# Ctags is a pretty useful utility to aid navigating source code. It creates a
# database of function/variable/type definitions within your code. Vi and Emacs
# support using a Ctags database, Nano (along with many other editors) does not.
# This script reads the database and finds the appropriate file and line to open
# the editor at (however Nano seems to lack any sort of plugin interface, adding
# support for finding a tag highlighted within the editor is not possible here)
#
################################################################################
#
# USAGE:
#
# Firstly you'll need to create the ctags database. Running "ctags -R" in your
# source directory should do the trick. For more advanced options to ctags, read
# the manual.
#
# Now you may run "nanoctags.sh <sometag>" to open nano at the point where it is
# defined.
#
# First the script attempts to find the tags database. You may specify one on
# the command line (eg: "nanoctags.sh <sometag> <dbfile>"), in the environment
# variable $TAGFILE, or let the script locate it for you. It searches the
# current directory and the parent directories until it finds one. Next it
# locates the relevant entry in the database. If you are not in the root of your
# source directory then it will search first for entries within your current
# directory, and then each of its parent directories until it reaches the folder
# containing the tags file. This means that if there are multiple definitions of
# the same name then it will try to find the one closest to where you are (and
# therefore hopefully the one you are looking for). Once the most appropriate
# entry is found, it is parsed and used to determine the correct filename and
# line number. Finally, Nano is opened at the correct location.
