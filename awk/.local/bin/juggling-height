# Usage: $0 THROW1 [THROW2=3] [DWELL=0.5]
# calculate relative height of siteswap THROW1 to another THROW2
# assuming throw are with made on an unchangin beats and fixed dwell time
#
# THROW1 and THROW2 should be integer >1
# DWELL represent the 'dwell ratio', which is the fraction of time that a hand
# has a ball in it. DWELL should be between 0 and 1, but is almost always
# between 0.3 and 0.7. Default value is 0.5.
