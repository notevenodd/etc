# Usage: $0 [THROW]...
#
# Prints the difficulty of the juggling sequence described by the given THROWs.
# The "difficulty" D is calculated as follow:
#             ___________________
#            |  ___
#            |  \              2        except when throw is 0,
#  D =  2 +  |  /__ (throw - 2)    <--- in that case, nothing is
#            |  ----------------        added to the sum.
#           \|  number of throws
#            `
#
# each THROW is supposed to be a valid mathematical expression which is
# evaluated by awk(1) intepreter, and then the formula is applied.
#
# Here are some examples:
# db97531 : $0 13 11 9 7 5 3 1 => 8.4
# (6x,4)* : $0 6 4             => 5.2
# [43]23  : $0 '4+1' 2 3       => 3.8 (assumption for the [43])
#
# This difficulty comes from Ben Beever's "guide to juggling patterns"
# https://www.jugglingedge.com/pdf/BenBeeversGuidetoJugglingPatterns.pdf
# which points out another difficulty measure could be:
# D = (average excitation level)/2 + number of balls
