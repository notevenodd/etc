# usage: $0 [THROWS]...
# prints the "difficulty" of the juggling sequence (siteswap)
# made of the given throws.
#
# The "difficulty" D is calculated as follow:
#             ___________________
#            |  ___
#            |  \              2       except when throw is 0,
#  D =  2 +  |  /__ (throw - 2)   <--- in that case, nothing is
#            |  ----------------       added to the sum.
#           \|       period
#            `
#
# note (all this c(sh)ould be improved)
# * only relevant for 3 balls or more
# * don't write a,b,c,... for throws >9, enter the numerical value
# * each throw separated by spaces
# * only understand vanilla sequence, not synchronous or multiplex
#     - for sync: enter all throws, drop the x
#     - for multiplex: replace the throw by something "believable"
#       [54] => 6, [44] => 5    ???
#
# examples:
# 441     : $0 4 4 1           => 3.7
# db97531 : $0 13 11 9 7 5 3 1 => 8.4
# (6x,4)* : $0 6 4             => 5.2
