# Note/Rationale: sh is dash in Debian/Ubuntu and Termux. Dash is meant
# to be used as as a fast POSIX-compliant shell interpreter, not really
# as an interactive shell, however it can be quite useful to be able to
# launch it interactively just for testing. In such case, dash is often
# compiled without any line support.
