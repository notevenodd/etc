# My hosts are on a wifi network. But I have also some old computers with only
# ethernet interfaces which I use on occasions. When using and bringing one of
# those hosts into my network, I just use the internet connection through the
# pi's ethernet interface. I can then connect the host with a crossover cable
# to the pi [then if neeed, assign a static address to the host with ip(8) or
# ifconfig(8)].
