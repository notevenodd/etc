# Weasel words
# ------------
# Weasel words --phrases or words that sound good without conveying
# information-- obscure precision.
#
# I notice three kinds of weasel words in my students' writing:
# (1) salt and pepper words,
# (2) beholder words, and
# (3) lazy words.

# Salt and pepper words
# ---------------------
# New grad students sprinkle in salt and pepper words for seasoning. These
# words look and feel like technical words, but convey nothing. My favorite
# salt and pepper words/phrases are various, a number of, fairly, and quite.
# Sentences that cut these words out become stronger.
#
# Bad:    It is quite difficult to find untainted samples.
# Better: It is difficult to find untainted samples.
# Bad:    We used various methods to isolate four samples.
# Better: We isolated four samples.

# Beholder words
# --------------
# Beholder words are those whose meaning is a function of the reader; for
# example: interestingly, surprisingly, remarkably, or clearly. Peer reviewers
# don't like judgments drawn for them.
#
# Bad:    False positives were surprisingly low.
# Better: To our surprise, false positives were low.
# Good:   To our surprise, false positives were low (3%).

# Lazy words
# ----------
# Students insert lazy words in order to avoid making a quantitative
# characterization. They give the impression that the author has not yet
# conducted said characterization. These words make the science feel unfirm and
# unfinished. The two worst offenders in this category are the words very and
# extremely. These two adverbs are never excusable in technical writing. Never.
# Other offenders include several, exceedingly, many, most, few, vast.
#
# Bad:    There is very close match between the two semantics.
# Better: There is a close match between the two semantics.

# Adverbs
# -------
# In technical writing, adverbs tend to come off as weasel words. I'd even go
# so far as to say that the removal of all adverbs from any technical writing
# would be a net positive for my newest graduate students. (That is, new
# graduate students weaken a sentence when they insert adverbs more frequently
# than they strengthen it.)
#
# Bad:    We offer a completely different formulation of CFA.
# Better: We offer a different formulation of CFA.

# A script to find weasel words
# -----------------------------
# With this script, you can supply an alternate list of weasel words in a file
# if you don't like the default:

weasels="many|various|very|fairly|several|extremely\
|exceedingly|quite|remarkably|few|surprisingly\
|mostly|largely|huge|tiny|((are|is) a number)\
|excellent|interestingly|significantly\
|substantially|clearly|vast|relatively|completely"

wordfile=""

# Check for an alternate weasel file
if [ -f $HOME/etc/words/weasels ]; then
    wordfile="$HOME/etc/words/weasels"
fi

if [ -f $WORDSDIR/weasels ]; then
    wordfile="$WORDSDIR/weasels"
fi

if [ -f words/weasels ]; then
    wordfile="words/weasels"
fi

if [ ! "$wordfile" = "" ]; then
    weasels="xyzabc123";
    for w in `cat $wordfile`; do
        weasels="$weasels|$w"
    done
fi


if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
 echo "usage: `basename $0` <file> ..."
 exit
fi

egrep -i -n --color "\\b($weasels)\\b" $*

exit $?
