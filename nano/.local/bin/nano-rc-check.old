# prints syntax errors from the nano config file
#
# RATIONALE: I usually start 'nano' as 'nano -q' for it not to obnoxiously
# report errors in the ~/.nanorc configuration file. As I may share one config
# files on several computers which have different versions of nano, the -q
# option is useful indeed. However one needs to be able to check if the syntax
# of the config file is correct, which is what this script does.


# we send a RETURN just in case there are errors, so nano starts the editor
# we put nano in a pipe, which will make it SIGHUP and terminate when it
# starts the editor
echo | nano 2>&1 |
grep -v '^Press Enter' | grep -v 'Received SIGHUP'
exit 0
