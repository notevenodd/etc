# Usage: nano+ [ARG]...
# launch nano(1) editor with some options (if your build of nano has them)
# based on the terminal size:
# if terminal is large enough, display line numbers
# if terminal has <20 lines  , do not show the two help lines at the bottom.


# has OPTION -> returns zero if nano has the given OPTION, non-zero otherwise
has() { nano --help | grep -qF -- "$@" ; }

# note: line numbers display has been introduced in nano 2.7.1 [end 2016]
# TODO: soon I won't have system with so old nano, so maybe testing those
#       options won't be necessary.
