# Usage: sedcheck [SCRIPT]...
#        ... | sedcheck
# sedcheck is a utility checking various portability issues (mostly
# POSIX conformance) in sed scripts. Sedcheck is itself written in sed.

#
# Sedcheck is rather pedantic (the first three warnings reported may not seem
# very useful or relevant), but this is because I applied (rather strictly) the
# following sources:
# - the recent POSIX spec (HTML version).
# - Sed and Awk, by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins (O'reilly).
#
# Now the good news is, that the overall framework and sed parser work
# correctly, and it is much easier to remove warnings that it was to add them.
#
# Sedcheck was tested successfully on the whole GNU sed testsuite and on many
# scripts from the grabbag. Nevertheless some bugs may still be there. Please
# report bugs and suggestions to me (see my email address below). I'd
# appreciate it particularly if sed programmers running other sed
# implementations than GNU sed could tell me whether some of the warnings
# currently in sedcheck are useless, or whether some other ones should be
# added.
