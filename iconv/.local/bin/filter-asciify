# transform the input to ascii and prints on stdout.
# this is a very simple wrapper to iconv(1)
#
# non-ascii characters will be transliterated (ie replace with
# similar looking ascii character) when it is possible (for example
# latin letter with accents, etc.) and if it's not posible replace
# with a '?'
