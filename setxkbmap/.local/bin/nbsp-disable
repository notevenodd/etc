# Usage: $0
# disable inputting a 'non-breakable space' (nbsp)
# character via the keyboard under X-window.
#
# On finnish or french keyboards I use, when you press
# <ALT-Gr> + <SPACE>, you get a nbsp (UTF8: \302\240).
# Nbsp displays like a space, so there's no way to see
# when you type one by accident (which is frequent).
#
# Note: The same result can be achieved in xorg.conf :
# add the following in the InputDevice section related
# to your keyboard:
# ...
# Option "XkbOptions"    "nbsp:none"
# ...

setxkbmap -option "nbsp:none"
