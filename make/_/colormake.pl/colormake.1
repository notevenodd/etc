.TH colormake 1 "July 2nd, 2001"
.SH NAME
colormake \- color wrapper for make(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcolormake\fR [ \-\-short ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
colormake acts as a wrapper around make(1) to ease reading the output by
colorizing it.
.SH OPTIONS
The \-\-short option instructs colormake to truncate lines so they do not wrap.
All other options will be passed unmodified to \fBmake\fR(1).
.SH USAGE
To change a makefile to use colormake, you may change the path at the top which
normally reads \fB#!/usr/bin/make\fR to \fB#!/usr/bin/colormake\fR.
.PP
Alternately, you may type \fBcolormake\fR whenever you would normally type
\fBmake\fR when compiling programs.
.PP
Colormake is also available using the alternate names which enable piping
through less (\fBclmake\fR), truncated output so lines do not wrap
(\fBcolormake-short\fR), or both (\fBclmake-short\fR).
.SH FILES
The configuration files are Perl scripts included by \fBcolormake.pl\fR.
The defaults values are (from \fBcolormake.pl\fR itself):
