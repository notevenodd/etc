colormake
---------

A script to color the output of make,
ripping-off colormake.pl by Bjarni R.
Einarsson, with some changes and
improvements.


To install:
    ./setup.py install

Or, just copy 'colormake' and 'colormake.py' to somewhere in the path.

Then, you may want to edit your bashrc, adding something like,
    alias make='colormake'


To run tests:
    ./setup.py test
