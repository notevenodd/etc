# w3m can display images in a terminal window
# (this works only on certain terminal which are based on xterm or rxvt)
# also see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2bMUtCOGko

# the critical compnent in w3m is: /usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay. It accepts
# some input on stdin and display the image, so there'd be a way to use only
# that and not full blown w3m, but I don't know how to do (#TODO in future?)

# we set the following w3m options with -o:
#   use external image viewer    => false
#   command to display image     => /usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay
#   confirm when quitting with q => false
w3m -o ext_image_viewer=0 \
    -o imgdisplay=/usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay \
    -o confirm_qq=0 \
    "$@"
