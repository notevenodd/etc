# Usage: $0 [FMT_OPTION]... [FILE]
# fmt (or stdin) for text email


# 1. Lowest common denominator is often considered to be 80-column text mode
# 2. Furthermore, RFC 2822 and RFC 5322 says length of lines in an e-mail
#    message should be no more than 78 characters.
# 3. Netiquette guideline in RFC 1855 suggest limiting lines to 65 characters.
#    This is a VERY conservative value. Up to 75 is used sometimes, but a high
#    number could run into problem if the message is quoted repeatedly.
#    We want to leave some room to others.

# get the file or - (stdin)
for i; do
    last=$i
done
[ -e "$last" ] || last='-'

# grep for replies '>' and if found, do use -p accordingly
