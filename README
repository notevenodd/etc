Miscellaneous scripts, wrappers, and configuration files
for commands and programs I may use.


To bootstrap a new machine
--------------------------

0) install git

1) # get my ~/etc dir
   $ mkdir -p ~/etc && cd ~/etc && git clone https://github.com/notevenodd/etc

2) # create my base directories
   $ ~/etc/true/~-bootstrap


After that and after installing some known programs
---------------------------------------------------

Deployement of ~/etc content into the home directory is best
managed by the 'etc-stow' script (which is powered by GNU stow)

0) make sure GNU stow is installed

1) # deploy conf and scripts as symlinks into ~
   $ ~/etc/etc-stow -R
   solve the stow conflicts, if any.

2) reload shell as there might be new aliases, etc.
   $ exec $SHELL -l
