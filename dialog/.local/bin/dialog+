# Usage: $0 [-X] [DIALOG_ARGS...]
#
# By default, dialog/whiptail draws its UI on stdout and output its result on
# stderr. This is very cumbersome! It's easier to use those programs while
# drawing the UI on the terminal (/dev/tty) and output result on stdin.
#
# Also, we use the terminal's alternative screen (if possible) so that
# dialog/whiptail doesn't alter the current screen. The -X option (which needs
# to be the first option) disables this [as sometimes, it's not wanted].
