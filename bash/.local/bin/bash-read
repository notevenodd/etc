#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Usage: $0 [bash_read_arg]...
# Calls bash's 'read' builtin and prints the answer.
#
# This could be used to call a better 'read' from a
# less sophisticated shell interpreter such as dash(1)
#
# Just an example:
# A=$(bash-read -p 'prompt: ' -i 'initial value')
# To see options/arguments, do: bash -c 'help read'
