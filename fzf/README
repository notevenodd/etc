fzf(1) (aka fuzzy finder) has become an important part of my workflow.
A recent version (or even the program) is not necessarily available
through the OS package manager, so I often just install it locally.
Here is in brief how to do so:

1) from ~/.local/src:
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git
   $Â cd fzf && ./install --bin  # <-- get the binary from your platform!

2) from ~/.local/bin:
   $ ln -s ../src/fzf/bin/fzf
   $ ln -s ../src/fzf/bin/fzf-tmux

3) from ~/.local/share/man/man1:
   $ ln -s ../../../src/fzf/man/man1/fzf.1
   $ ln -s ../../../src/fzf/man/man1/fzf-tmux.1


To upgrade fzf:
I have defined a 'fzf_upgrade' function which pulls
from github and then upgrade the binary.
