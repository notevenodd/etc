# history for the string of characters between the start of the current line
# and the current cursor position.

# This line sets readline to display possible completions using different
# colors to indicate their file types. The colors are determined by the
# environmental variable LS_COLORS, which can be nicely configured.
set colored-stats On

# This line sets auto completion to ignore cases.
set completion-ignore-case On

# This line sets 4 to be the maximum number of characters to be the common
# prefix to display for completions. If the common prefix has more than 4
# characters, they are replaced by ellipsis. For example, assume we are in a
# directory with files Screenshot_20170730.png and Screenshot_20170731.png. If
# using the default option, an auto completion prints Screenshot_20170730.png
# Screenshot_20170731.png. If this option is set, then the auto completion
# prints ...0.png ...1.png. However, if the common prefix is very short (fewer
# or equal to 3 characters), the full file names are still printed. For
# example, in a directory with files S10.png and S11.png, an auto completion
# still prints S10.png S11.png. This can be very useful when auto completing in
# a directory in which a lot of files have a long common prefix, such a camera
# image directory.

# This line sets every completion which is a symbolic link to a directory to
# have a slash appended.

# This line sets the completions to be listed immediately instead of ringing
# the bell, when the completing word has more than one possible completion.

# This line sets the completions to be listed immediately instead of ringing
# the bell, when the completing word has more than one possible completion but
# no partial completion can be made.
set show-all-if-unmodified On

# This lines sets completions to be appended by characters that indicate their
# file types reported by the stat system call.
