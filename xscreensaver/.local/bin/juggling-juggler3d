# I love juggling and it turns out xscreensaver has a juggler applet
# which can animate some (vanilla) siteswaps, neat!


# Usage: $0 {balls|clubs|rings|knives|bballs} PATTERN
# use the juggler3d 'applet' from xscreensaver to juggle some siteswaps
#
# PATTERN is vanilla siteswap separated by spaces.
# Any throw can be preceded with following modifier
# -   Inside throw (default)
# +   Outside throw
# =   Cross Throw
# &   Cross Catch
# x   Cross Throw and Catch
# _   Bounce
#
# For more: see man juggler3d(6x),
