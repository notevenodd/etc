# this is a basic readlink(1) in a kinda "portably"-manner
# doesn't accept options

# MORE INFO:
# readlink(1) should be present on GNU/BSD/Busybox, but it's not POSIX.
# However POSIX says 'ls -l' should output 'linkpath -> filepath',
# and so provided that the link's name does NOT include "->",
# the following should work:     L=$(ls -dl link)
#                                echo ${L#*-> }
#
# It feels brittle and ugly though!
